1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,920
Now we have all the pieces to put
together a proof of policy iteration.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,840
And since you have all the pieces,
you should be able to do it yourself.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,490
So here's what I'm doing.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,460
Let's take one step of policy iteration,
that is we start with some policy pi 1.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,220
And just for notation, we have Bellman
operator B1 associate with that policy,

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,030
and Q1 as the fixed
point of that operator.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,430
And then Q2 is the next policy we get.

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,070
It's the greedy policy with
respect to Q1 that we had from

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,860
the previous iteration.

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,880
And just again for notation, B2 will be
the Bellman operator for that policy,

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,920
and Q2 its fixed point.

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,570
And ultimately, what we want to show
is that the Q function that we get for

13
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,060
the second policy dominates
the Q function that we get for

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,660
the first policy.

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,142
And so this is how we're going to do it.

16
00:00:44,142 --> 00:00:46,311
Were going to have a series of steps.

17
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:49,133
And each of them has justification that
we've been talking about recently.

18
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:50,760
Just fill in the boxes.

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,350
&gt;&gt; Good, I think I understand what
you want and I think I can do it.

20
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,330
&gt;&gt; Yeah and we'll try to be a little bit
generous with what the names of these

21
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,130
justifications.

22
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,980
But I did give names of these steps
in some of the previous slides.

23
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,030
So I'm hoping that those words
should still be jumbling around.

24
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,730
&gt;&gt; Some of them anyway.
